## MSOS 2ND GENERATION NETWORK

The objective of this module is to facilitate communication for the server and its connected clients by providing a commonly shared
interface for developers to integrate networking into their applications. This module emulates and supports invocation and one-way
transmissions, while also having some security mitigations for some common areas that exploiters frequently attempt to attack. This
module works best from ReplicatedStorage, but is also compatible if a copy is replicated to individual clients. I, the developer,
recommend that you use the "2" variations of the invocation functions with a time-out to avoid malicious thread yielding unless
you are manually verifying data delivery using a separate thread. Each client should be importing a copy of this module to avoid
communication issues, as the system works under the assumption that each client has a running copy.

## NOTICE
Functions that begin with "NETWORK_" are intended for internal use only, and will propagate an error
back to any external threads when called. If a function you're calling accepts parameters "LOCAL_WRITE"
and/or "REMOTE_WRITE", it is best to set these values to be always "true". They are intended for state
keeping purposes, and it is not recommended to tamper with these unless you have extensive knowledge of
the code's internal workings. Functions that are meant for internal usage will NOT be included as part of
this API reference.

## API REFERENCE

`NETWORK_2G.new(DESIGNATION) --(string)`

Yields on the server.

Creates a new network.
On the server, returns the network class plus an array `{number, boolean|string}` of clients in tuple form.
The array serves to indicate if the clients successfully created the network on their end.
You may index this list in the form `{Player.UserId, boolean, string|nil}`. If the second index is anything
other than a "true" boolean, then you may use the index to output an error message. There is currently
no way to retry a network creation for a client in this network generation. You may disconnect the client
manually and ask them to rejoin or you may remove internal API restrictions and try again at your own
risk.

`NETWORK_2G:FireClient(PLAYER, ...) --(player?, ...:any?)`

Similar to RemoteEvent.FireClient, this function calls any connected nodes
on the network instance from a client (nil/false = all clients). See NETWORK_2G.Connect for more
details. The callback invoked may yield as there's no returned results expected. Additional
parameters are taken as a tuple and are passed in the same form when they reach the client nodes.

`NETWORK_2G:FireServer(...) --(...:any?)`

Similar to RemoteEvent.FireServer, this function calls any connected
nodes on a server network instance. The callback invoked may yield as there's no returned results expected.
Additional parameters are taken as a tuple and are passed in the same form when they reach the server nodes.

`NETWORK_2G:InvokeClient(PLAYER, ...) --(player?, ...:any?)`

Deprecated - Use InvokeClient2 with a time-out.

`NETWORK_2G:InvokeServer(...) --(...:any?)`

Deprecated - Use InvokeServer2 with a time-out.

`NETWORK_2G:InvokeClient2(PLAYER, TIME_OUT, ...) --(PLAYER:player?, TIME_OUT:number?, ...:any?)`

Yields.

Invokes the OnInvoke OR OnClientInvoke callback on a client network instance, the latter is deprecated.
Further network generation will support multiple invocation callbacks. The callback assigned may yield and
the parameters passed are taken as a tuple and are passed in the same form when they reach the client callback.

Any returned paramters from the callback are taken as a tuple and are returned in the same form as they were assigned.
If a client is not defined then the function returns an array in the form `{Player.UserId, any?, any?}`, where the second index
represents the first tuple the callback returned and so forth. It may also represent a false success boolean from a pcall and the
following index being the error message. Errors from calling a single client propagate to the caller thread.

ATTENTION - Not using a time-out puts you at risk for malicious thread yielding from exploiters, and it may hang your
caller thread indefinitely. This network generation does not support internal communication of the time limit to the
invoked callback, so it must respond as quickly as possible to avoid the channel closing from the other end. This
is something that will no longer be optional in later network generations, but will be preserved for the local communication
modules that are not yet released.

`NETWORK_2G:InvokeServer2(TIME_OUT, ...) --(TIMEOUT:number?, ...:any?)`

Yields.

Invokes the OnInvoke OR OnServerInvoke callback on a server network instance, the latter is deprecated.
Further network generation will support multiple invocation callbacks. The callback assigned may yield and
the parameters passed are taken as a tuple and are passed in the same form when they reach the server callback.

Any returned parameters from the callback are taken as a tuple and are returned in the same form as they were assigned.
Errors propagate to the caller thread.

ATTENTION - Not using a time-out puts you at risk for thread yielding, and it may hang your caller thread indefinitely.
This network generation does not support internal communication of the time limit to the invoked callback, so it must
respond as quickly as possible to avoid the channel closing from the other end. This is something that will no longer be
optional in later network generations, but will be preserved for the local communication modules that are not yet released.

`NETWORK_2G.Is2GNetwork(USER_DATA) --(USER_DATA:any?)`

Returns a boolean indicating if the passed parameter is a
network instance created by the active module.

`NETWORK_2G:IsConnected()`

Returns a boolean indicating if the network is not destroyed on the local machine
and is actively receiving any transmissions.

`NETWORK_2G:Connect(HANDLER) --( HANDLER:(...any?) -> () )`

Creates a new node instance on the network instance that will be called whenever the remote
environment calls a "Fire" function. That call will be directed at the passed handler function.
This function returns a mimic of the RBXScriptConnection "SCRIPT_CONNECTION_2G" class that has
property "Connected" and function "Disconnect" available.

`NETWORK_2G:Once(HANDLER) --( HANDLER:(...any?) -> () )`

Performs the same operation as NETWORK_2G.Connect, but will disconnect the
node from the network instance after receiving a single call from the remote environment.

`NETWORK_2G:Wait()`

Yields.

Performs the same operation as NETWORK_2G.Once internally, but instead yields the caller
thread until a transmission is received. The data passed is returned to the caller thread
immediately.

`NETWORK_2G:DisconnectAll(CLIENT, LOCAL_WRITE, REMOTE_WRITE) --(CLIENT:player?, LOCAL_WRITE:boolean?, REMOTE_WRITE:boolean?)`

Disconnects all nodes and nullifies invocation callbacks from a network instance. LOCAL_WRITE being a "true" boolean indicates
that you want to perform this operation on the local machine. REMOTE_WRITE being a "true" boolean indicates you want
to perform this operation on the remote machine - on the server, this is ignored, but acknowledged for record-keeping
purposes. You may also perform both operations on a single call. On the server, not setting a client with REMOTE_WRITE on
will send the request to all clients and the function will return a table in the form `{Player.UserId, boolean, nil|string}`
so that developers may verify which clients successfully executed the request. Individual requests will return a single boolean
to indicate success plus a string message for any errors. Setting a client with REMOTE_WRITE off from the server will cause the
server to only update its side while not communicating the change to the client, but this has no practical functionality.
The client does not use the client parameter and can be set to nil.

`NETWORK_2G:Destroy(CLIENT, LOCAL_WRITE, REMOTE_WRITE) --(CLIENT:player?, LOCAL_WRITE:boolean?, REMOTE_WRITE:boolean?)`

Destroys all nodes and nullifies invocation callbacks from a network instance, and removes the network instance from the
processing clock to avoid receiving further transmissions. LOCAL_WRITE being a "true" boolean indicates
that you want to perform this operation on the local machine. REMOTE_WRITE being a "true" boolean indicates you want
to perform this operation on the remote machine - on the server, this is ignored, but acknowledged for record-keeping
purposes. You may also perform both operations on a single call. On the server, not setting a client with REMOTE_WRITE on
will send the request to all clients and the function will return a table in the form `{Player.UserId, boolean, nil|string}`
so that developers may verify which clients successfully executed the request. Individual requests will return a single boolean
to indicate success plus a string message for any errors. Setting a client with REMOTE_WRITE off from the server will cause the
server to only update its side while not communicating the change to the client, but this has no practical functionality.
The client does not use the client parameter and can be set to nil.

ATTENTION - This function will resume all yielded invocations with a network destruction error.

`SCRIPT_CONNECTION_2G:Disconnect()`

Disconnects an individual node from a local network instance. Calling this function
will cause the node and its assigned handler to no longer receieve data transmissions
from the remote machine, and will set the connection instance's "Connected" property to
false if it succeeded. Subsequent calls all get ignored, and this function will always return
a "nil" value.

Further details might be added as development continues. You generally want to set LOCAL_WRITE and REMOTE_WRITE
to a "true" boolean if those parameters are provided.
